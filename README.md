=============

## Purpose

This Ruby command line program was developed during the Pragmatic Studios's Ruby course:

http://online.pragmaticstudio.com/

The program is a game that features players during multiple rounds of play. During each round, a player gains or loses points, and finds treasures, which both contribute to the player's final score.

## How it was built

The program was built in Ruby, and contains the following features:

* An object-oriented design using multiple classes, modules and inheritance.
* Custom iterators
* Input accepted from the command line. CSV files may be input to the program that contain a list of players.
* Output to the screen and a txt file showing the high scores during the game.

The game is distributed as a RubyGem. The directory follows the recommended Gemfile structure.
